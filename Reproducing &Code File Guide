In this document, we will be guiding you through the two code files we have, and show the reporducing process at the same time.

Before we proceed, please open up the code document named "Project_Extract+Cleaning"
1. Importing and downloading necessary libraries
You should see the import list at the top of the code file. However, because we are using Kaggle, there are few things needed before you are allowed to extract any document from it.
You need to going to Kaggle and create an account. Then, under "Account", tap "user profile" and scroll down to click "Create new token". You will be needing the downloaded kaggle.json
file when Kaggle verifies your identity. You will then need to store this file into a hidden folder named ".kaggle", you can create such folder by pressing Comman+Shift+Period together 
on Mac, and then simply drag the downloaded file into the folder.

Furthermore, we need to use pip to install necessary components. We need to download kaggle, recordlinkage, and duckdb in the format of "pip install ___ "
