The original project plan set out to study global earthquake activity and compare it to long-term changes in Earth’s surface temperature, using two large datasets from Kaggle. The goal was never to prove causation but to look for patterns over time and across regions. The early project work focused on downloading the datasets, cleaning them, and preparing them for analysis. Since then, the project has moved forward in a pretty significant way. The biggest change is that everything has now been automated through Python. Instead of downloading files manually, the datasets load directly through the KaggleHub API, which gives us full reproducibility. Integrity checks using SHA-256 hashing are also built into the workflow, which helps verify that the data we are analyzing is the same every time. This shift in approach has made the project cleaner, more reliable, and easier to maintain.
